We’re either going to wish we sold our calls on that green candle

Or we’re going to wish we had bought in before the rally continues. 

Let’s find out tomorrow! See you then gents!

Go lose your virginity behind Wendy's.
I loaded up on calls
Due to a clerical error "Fill Team Six" was accidentally hired today. The intern responsible has been terminated.
my cock, i suspect
they tried to sneak it in there
So, honestly I've had to change my whole investing thesis upon moving to THE ISLANDS (get on my level plebs).

Basically, there is no fucking way I'm getting as early as I would need to to day trade. So I have to make all decisions based effectively on the EOD  behavior of the market and whatever. This bgg is weird because usually I like to trade that first hour, and that's that. Have to reconsider my whole principal here.
He truly belongs here!

BEARS WITH THE DOUBLE REVERSE
VXX calls to hold over the weekend might be a safe play
Gonna rip down. Hate to say it but love to see it 🌈🧸
Tomorrow is gap up or gap down no in between... Not sure I made the right choice but account goes bust if wrong lol 🤷‍♀️ great flair btw
What😳u know NVDA is heading to 250 soon
PLUG calls
There we go gap on SP500 is filled now
Capitulate and fuck around, see what happens
I have TSM calls, so I'm gonna go with that
Wow that went from name brand diapers to store brand quick. Hope u don’t fuck me spy.
Upstart heading to $500 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I did. It held above 441.52. Inverse h&amp;s on the weekly chart with a nice confirmation today.
SPY Put with .9 delta filled at 442.56 🥰🥰🥰
I bought in today to play earnings, so I'd hope so

There's no way spy doesn't dump tomorrow right? Like this is obviously a set up? Right? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)

well, that's a relief.  I thought substantially similar security meant the same stock or any derivatives of said stock.  I have made only about 1k gains from SPY this week and obviously different strike dates and prices, so i guess I'm golden?
what came first the ban or the flair
this is super bullish in case you want to hold your puts overnight.
Ballsy. I’ve been playing puts since early September but we look pretty bullish right now. Tomorrow will be interesting tho

This power hour is 🌈
Holding my calls because I like believe in America or whatever.
Most of the monkeys shrieking on here have only traded for like a year and have no fucking clue. Your assessment is fair and logical, personally I think the rally is going to carry into the weekend
So you sold a certain call for a 3k loss and then bought back the exact same strike and expiration and got at least a 3k gain on it? Because that’s the only way you’d get hit with a wash sale for that amount. You can just buy a different strike or expiration after you take a loss on one and the wash sale rule won’t apply
the way it works is: whatever you do will be wrong but not until you make the decision to do it. The Copenhagen retardation
I can't believe spy held all day. Sold $436 calls right after open and bought puts. And now I'm thinking it will hold tomorrow too.
Any recommendations on calls to buy ?
Make a bolder bet, that target is too close.

im generally bullish, and i usually try to base my trades off of the general zeitgeist of WSB being late to the party or holding on to a trade for too long - case in point today, eventually bad news gets priced in and it seems like a lot of folks on the board get trapped thinking a trend will never reverse

Like the old WSB
I’d be up 2k on spy Puts I bought at 442.50 but a win is a win regardless
I have been to, then laying awake last night I realized that I disqualified a 3k loss on spy calls from last month because 30 days hadn't gone by.

What kind of spy puts we doing
Bears I’m sorry we are all so mean to you sometimes. On the bright side though if you keep letting the bulls remain irrational y’all will get to eat huge next year on the US indexes. Sucks being early as a bear, but I think if you play your cards right you’ll get it right in a big way on the next opportunity.
Daily Apple dump stinks
Do you think BNTX will ever go back to 300? I might have eat this 7k loss. Result of CSPs gone so very wrong.
No bags. All profit now
At least you didn’t buy 3355cs 0dte like that other guy

Wish my porty was bigger so I could sell in the money puts on PTON. But allocating 6k to one ticker is too much
how do i join![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Pos bank and company overall
Spy up 1.5% and BA down 1.9%. All is right with the world.
Wtf did you buy puts on
IV was around 80% when I bought, i dont play those crazy volatile 100%+ stocks
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
The market has ripped higher two or more days in a row like this too often for me to feel good about buying puts right now. I have no idea.
Spy getting little breather before running to $445 tomorrow. That’s alright spy take your time bby
do people hold overnight in this sub? i thought buying and selling in the same day was the best way to maximize your tax exposure.
there's 90 bucks down the drain
They quit because they found other jobs. That’s like saying you’re company made $0 yet has $1B in revenue. Media will hype anything up just like the did with fake eviction news for months

Man I’ve only been playing spy, no individual stocks always play atm. It’s been great I’ve had an excellent month.

Something really b big is going down, too bad we have that MC rule here.
According to the conspiracy apes, BAC incurred trillions in losses from shorting GME and that's why they had network outages.

Well, looking at their shares today they did a *really* fucking good job tricking PWC.  Again!

Hey guys, just wanted to say FUCK WFC

If even one institution shorted right now SPY would drop 4 dollars they're all just too pussy (yes i'm exaggerating)
Been stewing
Yeah they have a public meeting on the 20th… calling the bull run and jumping on this for no gain is insane.  They diluted
Guys im up $5.84 on my spy put, im a big shot now
Mrna is a buy obviously

They said earnings from Banks were good even though all they did was release reserves. Wtf is even that?

wait wait new integra????
wtf is going on with CLNE options?!? bought january $10 calls when it was down -1.5% and then when it recovered almost 2% my calls didnt move and now its dropping again and calls will prolly drop fuuuuck
I read a bioplastics DD that started off sounding the ranting of a Burry Jr and by the end I have to say it was pretty compelling.
I feel like when I lose it’s so easy, and when I win have to Fukin claw for my gains
Literally anything can make your credit score go down bro.  I paid off my house and it dropped by 20 points.
This answer makes the most sense. Thank you.
yes but which rug???

If you have to ask if you should take profits, you probably just want someone to tell you to take profits.
No because my limit order NEVER HIT. Second IPO bonanza in a row I've got boned on, but I refuse to a put a damn market order in.
They’re high
good luck next september bears

with that said, im definitely buying the new 6-speed Integra when it comes out. shits an investment at this point with better returns than my trading account lol

Biden also said the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts could soon make a decision on authorizing vaccines for children ages 5 to 11.
“The good news is the FDA and outside experts in the CDC are set to make a determination as to whether the vaccination will be authorized for that age range in the next few weeks,” he said.
Biden said the administration is prepared if vaccines are authorized for children, saying that enough vaccines for children ages 5 to 11 have been purchased.

per the news article, US Govt has already purchased the vaccines and are just waiting for approval - what are they gonna do with the ones purchased, throw it in the garbage. I think the approval is just red tape.
🐂🐮♉
agreed, i rag on bers constantly, but this place sucks without them. Remember that GME bullshit?
The money would have changed you. You’re better off.

By being an old bag holder for BB and SOFI, I'm feeling pretty good today.
Puts. Not bc the stupid bull or bear shit. Spy goes up one day then it goes down next day and vise versa
I'm trying to get tendies come on spy hit 453 so I can collect these 50 racks
Dont make me buy it. I'll crash the fuck outta of it as it loses 80 percent of its value once I hit the buy button
10Y Yields falling coupled with earnings season around the corner in addition to our "recovery" from the annually scheduled blood-red September.
Ok 👍🏽
Me not.

Yeah we're gonna be having ass to mouth for dinner since we got fucked

You made a really short custom ban bet (None) which was not accepted.
Don't put any text after the time token (1m, 1w, 15d) if you don't intend to carry out an interesting punishment to get unbanned early.
If you find my car keys we can drive out of here!

10/15 439p or 445c, what say you?
We want a rug pull not another bear kill
yoooo that's exactly how you lose money. Play a position at the wrong time, then switch just as momentum is changing.
AMC is an alluring and fickle mistress friend... it giveth and it taketh away in equal measure. You're in good company. After some narrow scrapes I've learned not to touch it until it plummets below that \~$35 mark. Take it as $1.5k lesson in YOLOing and be thankful it wasn't more.
My credit util went from 3% to 11% and they dropped it by 6 points. I hate myself
Banbet that it doesn’t go below 440?

SPY is up almost 2% today, expecting a pull back tomorrow
Make a bolder bet, that target is too close.
What is cent?
I am but that’s not the point lol. I’m not gunna deny it though I am experienced
finally sold ocugen
#BBags update: I’m down just 17% now!
Man I had shll calls way back when that were up 550% at one point and I didn't sell them.. been looking at 2023 LEAPs too. They're pretty cheap. Maybe get some shares to sell CCs against.

Wrong.  Just shows if call forwarding is enabled.
I thought number one rule on Wall Street was don’t fight the feds. Why are some fighting the feds?
Imagine BB skyrockets AH, I know it won’t but just imagine 🐒💨
Because it was last week. Literal same chart
Dude I gotta stop paperhanding FD’s
I'd love to know the reasoning for those buying 450 calls after a 1.5% up day right before options expiry Friday.
Fuck everything else UPST is a money glitch
well that escalated quickly

High risk high reward. I didn't get into this stock to get poor. I'm holding this till it kills me or makes me
True.
SPY so weak right now
Ooh. What was premium on that bad boy
I can help you find the ones that are 10x loss gain
everyone do this immediately

edit: if it doesn’t work, that means you’ve been wiretapped.
Why not more calls lol
That’s call forwarding
Was down 20k on puts now im about to break even my resolve will not wither lets go
Puts are where it’s at for tomorrow and then switch to calls again
Anyone got news on ABNB? Why it's down when the rest of the market is up?
Buckle up for nothing
[deleted]
yeah but here in this sub we only look ahead the next 5 minutes.  so 0dte. if you bought spy calls at open today you'd be up big.
We're here to make money, high volatility is great for day trading, and Mango was phenomenal at causing volatility.
MSFT all time high tomorrow? 🤔
Big box of rats
Not on US indexes not a chance
That’s why I don’t think 450 will happen tomorrow
0 IQ play, perfect!

DON'T CALL IT A COME BACK
Ugh still waiting for my 10/27 440 calls I bought 2 weeks ago to break even. It's close. Power hour looking to be making up to be a big fat bitch tho
Oh i cant explain how much i love UPST
ohhhhh good pt.
Make a bolder bet, that target is too close.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Oh hi again. Hope your your words taste good! I bought more shares, having a goodtime

Reminder: I trade PLTR, different than investing. In case you were confused.
What should I buy. I own Tesla, Corsair and some ETF’s. I need something to trade and something to hold. Spam your plays
visualmod test reeeee do something
You short on it or what? It’s been going vertical this week lol

I can stay irrational longer than the market can stay solvent

Goddamn did that parade of CEOs pump the shit out of those stocks after-hours. It was absolutely hilarious.
its a rocket chart man. ever since the aug earnings
I need another % up from V today
Keep in mind a lot of the people that are reading this are the same people that need 10:1 baggers in order to break even. If they're right 15% of the time and taking profit at 50% they're gonna get wiped.
Recession over again
Take 2k and learn how to trade credit spreads.  it's slow, steady boring money.
Inflation is permanent? You telling me arizona aint gonna be 99 cents no more? $1.50?

Yes...good question...
Just do it again til ur net balance is 0.00
SQ puts. Thank me later.
Anyone else get the feeling that the CCP is going to make $BABA blow up just to flex on the US?
I think it’s fucking funny how bears are always the arrogant overconfident type that thinks they will be the ones to call the top on shit, and then I, one of the most permabull type people ends up being the one who made a shitload of money when I actually bought puts at 454 which was a relative top. Bears really are dumb, permabulls end up actually being better at it than they are. And fortunately I was smart enough to dump those puts at the bottom too. Priceless
the twitter pumps were glorious
been feeling quite depressed bc i haven’t found a good play the past two weeks, market feels sus to me and i lost most of my money on SPY calls. 

So i’m using the last of my buying power on 1DTE SPY puts as my final hail mary, 100% expecting to blow up my account
50 contracts 10/15 447 spy call. Let's get rich 😎 bull gang or no Gang
What was the catalyst though?
I'm retarded when it comes to IV, you're saying people are buying lots of puts essentially. I didnt know that is part of how you calculate IV
We're living in a simulation and how the market behaves everyday is determined by a random number generator.
inflation... they were talking about inflating the bubble... not prices inflating

Why ?

i miss when mango man was 30 mins late to a press conference, paraded a bunch of ceo's on stage making me lose 3k, and then once market closed it was doom n gloom. Had to hold that shit over the weekend but ended up being uppies by about 7k
such a fucking tease. go up dammit
I bought a couple 10/20 442p and 443p, both slightly green right now but I have crazy tight stop losses on them. Fully expect the stops to trigger but we just seem so primed to give a little bit back after this runup that I couldn’t help it. Not gonna hold overnight

Figured that.  You are an Australian in the UK.  I win.
FUCK YEAH
I should have called it quits at 1030
Last year I got caught up with my pants down when small caps took a dump. Been working my way out of the ditch ever since
Common prosperity for all retards everywhere &lt;3
Lmao dude.. These are played out, what are you doing..
Naw I'm deadass contemplating taking my profits and dipping.
[deleted]
Say I want to sell a put. To avoid having to pay the spread, is there any way to coordinate with someone else who wants to buy a put? Or to say that I'm somewhat flexible regarding the exact strike and expiration? Like, could I put in a bunch of orders in a bunch of different contracts, but have only one get filled?
Yup couldn't be me... 👀
Been saying it for a month on the daily thread. Maybe this will catch your attention.
OCGN bought at open and sold three hours later for 3.5x. Thank you.
Thought I made the wrong move earlier… but now it looks like I made the right move 🤴🏻
If bears can’t get spy back under 432 by the end of the month it’s over for them for a hot minute.
Me too - tomorrow red
because I took a shitload of profits today and I ain't the only one.  Good chance there's  a rush to cash in tomorrow.
I’m high on life my guy
Indian burn? Nice 👍
My crystal balls say SPY will dip towards eod. Buying puts, wish me luck.
Just imagine if the IRS automated and just told everyone (regular working folk) what they owed or got back (a la UK) then we wouldn't have to do this shit and they could focus their efforts on big corps and the super rich.   


PLTR software would recommend this immediately and solve alot of problems. Huge contract, big payout. Stock down 3%
if it’s important they’ll leave a message.
Dang didn't realize GitLab IPO'd today. Imagine if GitHub IPO's lol. That bish gon' go from 100 to 1000 in a day. Yeah I know MSFT bought them.

Selling NIO puts to absolute dumbasses has been insanely profitable this year and I’m kind of sad because I actually want to get assigned
Fuck I hope so, holding 2300 shares and I could do with a run past 36 👍
Fuck inflation, fuck the taper. SPY is done fucking around. Take off is now, $475 by Thanksgiving
The trick is that the where I’m from and the where I’m am aren’t the same!
Hey SPY, suns getting real low.......
TSLA puts in the low 700s for tomorrow still priced in the 100$ range per contract.
SPY puts at at close?
Swing trading is fun until you get ur cock burned

your a day early buddy. buy tomorrow afternoon for the weekend.
PSFE is such great value rn, just going to keep pouring my money in.
Yeah i noticed, why is that
Imagine shorting upst
Sold right at that 378 moment, wondering if itll shoot up again, 9% day is hefty
These may be the cheapest they'll be in a while, or you'll go slap ass broke. I hope to get to the moon with an unspanked ass.
MODS LOVE ME!!

$SOFI $APPS $ZIM $CLF
Spy wants to bust that 50 dma so bad.
Keep buying puts for tomorrow bears, manifest your lambos! 😁
I don’t believe that, at least until next month
Probably wouldn’t hold SPY calls overnight…

Tomorrow gonna continue trading sideways to fuck most options
being theta gang is so satisfying
$600 million shelf raise announced end of August.  Before this morning it was ddown 14% over the last month while the underlying was up around 28% during the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon as the announcement is made, this will probably trade mid- to upper-$30s.

&amp;#x200B;

Book value, post-dilution (if it took 20 million shares to get there) will be around 11 to 12 for their 3Q21 with a MC even today of just under $3B.  MARA is a $4.5B company?  RIOT is profitable and will have increasing margins as they move from their third party NY site to Whinstone.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a ton of bullish catalysts ahead.
TSLA put IV climbing fast

It's a pretty simple case of r = 0.
A colleague took me to his country club yesterday. It was super nice. Loved it but I look more like the staff than the members. Will have to get invited back.
Wow SPY refused to give me even the tiniest of dips today lol. Pretty impressive honestly.
That was monday and tuesday bud. sorry about your luck
Lol wtf is TSLA doing
Cook County, IL😭
I had a bad experience with an all inclusive brekkie in Spain so I think I know what you mean.
TSM going to thrive from power hour? They'll open up 114 or better tomorrow.
Imagine Palantir got a contract from the IRS. 

Tax revenue collection would jump 10492%
Shouldn’t everyone be taking profits or na. I need spy to die quickly and biggly

GME doing what it does. Pumps and then dumps, rinse and repeat. That's all it does, lol. No more huge runs from it. Just these little pumps and then shits itself.
*looks at the very deep in the red TLRY calls expiring tomm*
It pumped 10% ah that day then dumped. Now it's coming back. Just pltr things
I recouped my last month loss, and some more. Ready with somy cash now
Humblebrag
Sour hour taking charge now 😭😭. Tesla and chpt looking like they losing steam
It was a nice day and I thing we see a dip and another rip tomorrow
THIS is a boring day for SPY. Looking like a 1 year chart or some shit instead of a 1 day. I’d much rather have it stuck in a $2 range but constantly bouncing up and down between the limits of that range
press conference?
It likes 24 too much to move very far away from there.
Is SPY gonna dip like it usually does at around the 3rd week of every month or will it finally break?
Drill team 6 deploying?
I appreciate your service 🇺🇸

Pre-market tomorrow for the announcement.
I'm trying to come up with a clever comeback to this but I can't. Thank you for your service.

I'd love a 'why' explanation for people buying puts here. The institutions clearly have the green light to inflate the bubble for another 3-6 months. Its go time retards.

You ain't that special ok!
Can it go up? How much higher do you want it??
YETI just needs a smidge more for 5% today. Still doesn't help my lost cause calls though.
PLTR got an $800 million contract Oct 5th and is just slowly starting to creep up now?? What am I missing here?
u/cashflow_ okay I guess I was very very wrong, hopefully it's a sour hour or it's back to the breadline for me
UPST really went full gamma squeeze, TSLA bat shit crazy mode.

Starbucks stock grinds higher, can it boil up to new highs?

the way AMZN is behaving you would expect there to be some horrific news about it. MOVE BITCH
442.50 nah
Will this happen again next week? Dip to low 430s by Wednesday then rip $10 into thursday, just like last week. Find out on the next episode of no one fucking knows.
Buying puts is against my religious beliefs. I worship the bull god. Bear worshippers are infidels.
Hoping for NFLX to hit 640 so I can get some cheap puts for earnings.

Probably cause it’s a better job lol
WTF, I have the power to make everything go down except the things I want to go down
I've been wondering what the fuck has been going on with this stock the last few weeks this must be it
We can drop any minute. No way it’s retail holding this up mate. But if we close 442 that’s a good thing also
[deleted]
So more spy calls? No way it dips tmw
Not yet... Firms like Palantir and other big tech companies are trying to change it.

TBH if you could actually find unadulterated cocaine I'm sure it wouldn't be nearly as bad for you as the shit you find on the streets.  I know you're not supposed to snort cocaine, but you're REALLY not supposed to snort laxatives, baby powder, lidocaine, or fentanyl.

Loading up on 1DTE OTM FDs on RIOT before the bell.

If they announce the shelf raise is complete by PM tomorrow then I could see a close of $26.50 to $27 opening at $30+.  Delta and short covering takes over to push it to an intraday high of $35 to $38.

If I'm wrong, my bet probably expires worthless.

Doesn’t have to be boring. I made $2500 today buying 10/22 calls on plug during its dip. The stock only moved 2% and yet I was still able to profit 47%. Now I’m onto the next one. Repeat.
I could yolo all my life savings on GME 500 for tomorrow, BUT I WOULD NEVER risk a ban.

If I lose money I can just come here and I know some other asshole will have also lost money on the same thing and we can all be sad and make memes together. But if I get banned then who am I gonna share all my idiocy with?

Burry is the same person who bought GME in Jan and think they're the best trader in the world

TRADING TIP

Follow a particular stock for a week. Learn it’s trends. Study it’s price movements. Buy calls when she dips. 

You’re welcome
Well at the very least no more options for me. Just doing recurring payments to a bullshit stock and hold it for 10 years.

Fucking suck ass at day trading
I lost it all yesterday on spy puts, inverse-brother

Some serious fuckery going on with WBA. Yesterday, I wanted to roll out my 10/15 covered call which was 20% OTM. Should have been 2 or 3 pennies to close. Instead, the IV is jacked to like 85%. Huge volume and OI on deep OTM calls expiring today. Someone knew this was about to blast off and made a fuck ton of $$$

Yea this year has probably been the worst in history for the manipulation. Market makers are mad retail won’t leave and sell for losses.

Oddly enough I will be in St Croix for the first 3-4 days of this ban.. but the days after I’m back are going to be awful
True. Here’s an upvote.
I'm going to tell you guys how the GME saga ends.

Apes direct register enough shares to prove they hold the entire float per GME. The market is forced to acknowledge that hedge funds created a shadow float of fake shares and the market is entirely rigged, but since everyone already knows the market is entirely rigged, it is NBD and the price stays flat. Apes sell and go home after realizing nobody cares that the market is entirely rigged, and even if you mathematically prove it is rigged, nobody cares.

I love they are doing the work to prove it, but guys, we already know this mofo is the most rigged game in town. Just ask Brandon.
Anybody buy that PLUG dip?
literally have a face melting spy rally the day after i lose it all on puts
Power hour who’s got their popcorn ready
Lmfao imagine forcing someone to inject themself. If your vax is safe and effective it shouldn’t worry you
Power hour coming soon 🦾 spy 444 eod
It’s weird when stocks like CLOV get memed, just their business model is an odd fit for it 

Getting memed is for businesses like failing dental appliance companies,  failing brick and mortar game stores, failing movie theater chains, failing car rental companies, etc
probably because of the FOMC minutes

the fed essentially confirmed that we are getting at least another 6 months of heavy QE

thats my guess
Take profit. Can’t be mad if you make money.
Lmao yup. My 440c I got for .30….. it stings a little

It's been educational reading his tweets, only insofar as they made me realize that having millions of dollars could never fix anything that's broken inside me. He could be doing anything else, yet he's complaining about bullshit politics on twitter. It does seem like money has vastly diminshing returns beyond a certain level vs. quality of life.
Nah I'm yoloing all my savings into retarded meme stocks

[deleted]
you kinda hit it; its most likely to keep up.

But the damage is done, and its increasing. We've destroyed the middle class, and made the lower class lower with inflation. Coupled with supply chain issues, theres going to be a point where people just stop buying shit because they cant afford it. Enjoy these good ERs while they last. 

Literally a K shape recovery, and everything reverts back to a mean. And it doesnt look like wages/lifting the lower class up is how we're going to do it. So either we massively deflate in the future, or inflate so much only a few people can enjoy buying stupid shit, and that just just destroys profit margins overall.

Im fine accepting people going long for a quick scalp or swing. but people who truly believe we can keep going up are brain dead.
i buy puts one time and we get an absolute faceripper of a day  


never again

Thanks for the answer. With inflation running higher, assets are bound to see an increase in prices though, correct? It seems like this will continue to go on until the Fed tapers
WTF happened to my memes while I was working
Hey did stimulus go out in which states
I made a grand off a call at the end of September and then another off a put at the beginning of October. I thought maybe since it's gone up so far like it did last time it would go back down but that does not seem to be the case at the moment.
SPY is not happy with your shit, bulls

Petition for mod to add hunger game tribute fallen sound effect on lost ban bets.
AFRM... just can't be stopped.

Big volume... institutions playing catch up.
literally made a ban bet on monday for TSLA to go from 780-800 - not everyone is a permabull/bear
Or paper handing calls
I’m so sorry! That’s definitely rough. I hope you’re doing okay.

4 digit gains every day this week!

It's just too bad those digits have a decimal point in the middle.

If you make a banbet in reply to someone else's comment visual mod attributes it to them. Use this information wisely.

I so wanna get long dated UPST puts but I have no balls.
UPST has almost same P/E as TSLA

What are they making actually ?
It wasn’t that popular before then. It didn’t reach “beyond PRPL” levels of stupid popularity until 300

Wrong. I’ve been here for 3 years. DFV started posting updates on his position in 2019. WSB has been in since then. GME 300+ 1mo
Anybody else use wsb daily threads as a journal/ log entry? Looking back at my conviction this week. 🤣😂💀🤡
Is there anyone who unironically calls themselves an “ape” who didn’t hop on there WSB bandwagon during the January 2021 influx or later?

It’s true! If you were around before late January, GME holders weren’t the sick QAnon-esque cult they are today. 

Then there was an influx of noobs who came in late January and embarrassed the rest of WSB into submission. Luckily most of them have left for the cultist subs now.
Capitulated on my condors. Fucking fuck. I need it to be pay day so I can reload.
Dont give up on SDC. I don;t think it will moon but has potential for $9. Reasoning behind this is... I have a feeling.

Nuts man, that thing had 3-6% days for 5 or 6 days last time it ripped like this. Hopefully it does again

I got in at 125ish. Calls are doing great again now.
Started trading SPY two weeks ago and went 5 for 5 but with little money. This week I got confident and so put tons more money. This week I am 0 for 1 million

Dude honestly your boss doesn't give 2 shits about you.
out of all the things you could have pointed to for advancing civilization you chose the worst ones. 

rockets dont need to go to mars, they just need to get a load out of the atmosphere. 

FSD is important, but computer vision is certainly not new.

EV's are questionable on benefits. ESPECIALLY E-trucks.

Starlink is probably the best contribution 

TSLA is only FSD and EVs. The others are under different companies. Combining TSLA and Elon is a mistake. Imagine he SpaceX becomes succesful and TSLA is left in the dust as a car company. its true valuation would go below every other current car manufacturer

TSLA isn't just a car company. It has software and new technology wrapped as a car company.

The reality is Elon is moving civilization forward with electric cars with self driving technology and building rockets that can one day reach Mars. The fact that someone like that is the CEO of TSLA makes it all the more valuable.

It seems like the safest way to trade is wait till WSB hypes something at fever pitch, then short the shit out of it. IRNT, CLOV, WISH, GME @ 300, PRPL… 

The more WSB retards are certain it’ll moon, the more guaranteed return you’ll get by shorting it.

Look at the trustpilot reviews for Paysafe. It seems really sketchy IMO
I think I'll buy some $F 15.5 FDs at EoD if it's less than $0.10 of $15.5
needs to go much much higher. You can look up charts, 5% inflation isn't bad for spy
youre right i did. Ive never seen a korean submit so hard to someone who doesnt give a shit about them. its pathetic. youre not saying fact. you are PROJECTING your idealized thoughts.

Could go either way. My guess is the big guns expect us to load up on puts now so tomorrow will be flat or green? Maybe slightly red but nothing major. Just talking out my ass
Gme

Imagine thinking anyone cares about your weak sauce.
Calls on BABA?
Naked shorting?  Selling shares that don’t exist?  Proving your original post incorrect?
V to $250 again would make my cock harder than it's been since junior year
i'd pay extra if you did tho
&gt; Not sure who you think you are for speaking in the place of elon and wsb as a whole.

You changed this from "You give Koreans a bad name" lmfao

All I'm saying are fact. Fact check before feeling like you're being attacked for spitting misinformation.
As gas prices go higher and inflation ripps my ass apart, i wonder how long before it starts hurting the economy. Lower usd causing higher demand on oil as its bought in usd. Higher cost of everything slowing down econimy lowering usd making oil prices go even higher. Like a bad loop with hints of 2007

Your entire existence is weak sauce

Well I just bought SPY puts for the first time in a while. Time for spy to rip back to 450 to teach me a lesson again.

Everything you do is weak sauce.
If I’m flagged pdt twice and deposit money on Tuesday to bring it back up to 25k - will I be able to day trade again? Thanks in advance fellas
Calm down satan. Was gonna say 1 month ban or mod lol
I do appreciate how close TSLA's market cap is to it's stock price

This reporting platform we use at work sucks huge dicks. There’s a quick reports, and custom reports. 

These fucking idiots at this company that provided the service don’t use the same field names between quick and custom reports, and there are certain fields you can only get from one and not the other arbitrarily for no fucking reason

Why the fuck can I not view Discounts in a fucking custom report on fucking revenue? The alternative is running like 50 fucking quick downloads for reports on each individual event and combining them. Are you kidding me?

The market already expected inflation to stay longer than the fed was saying it would… slower growth already priced in and it doesn’t matter because companies became more efficient over the pandemic and they now need less people to accomplish the same so profit margins can still be good. Now the market is just looking forward to supply chain issues being sorted out so I am not anticipating and crash or recession

This one time at band camp oil went negative so I went balls deep in GUSH leaps not knowing shit and fuck and now I own a bunch of worthless GUSH2 leaps that I can’t sell and will mock me until expiration.
I usually can pull them to close to a 10 bagger. Then every day after is a 20-40% loss
Sold my square  And Bank of America last week. Shit Fire like my grandmother used to say Don't leave anything on the table
447/8 for me
Corsair to $30 EOW!
Time for Puts?
Buy protection while you can, not when you must.
The trick is to make those wins each a 20 bagger or better to make up for all the losses
WHY ISNT ANYONE DISCUSSING OCGN?!?! WHO APPROVAL IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN!!
Bears: don’t buy Puts expiring tomorrow 

Get them for the 20th if you betting on a massive rug pull like every OPEX this year and the historical low point of October 

Fucking cheap Puts now that VIX got crushed
He doesn't even have a PR team. Everyone knows he has no filter and do you know where you are? WSB love Elon for a reason. He was the chief engineer at SpaceX and brought electric cars to market. To earn WSB's respect you need to actually have merits.

Nah. Slight downward move and then rip into close. I think we break 443 today, if only just barely. Especially if 441.52 holds.
I’ve lost half my portfolio this past week after climbing for a 25% gain over two months… all I can say is theta gang sniffs used underwear

I’m pretty much ready to off myself here, I can only say it’s just money so many times. I HATE losing and it’s all I’ve been doing the past 2.5 months. I held my 442c all week, held through all the red days and didn’t set a stop loss. Finally set on this morning at a small loss on my initial investment and of course it hits… those calls are now a 2 bagger. I can’t fucking win, I hate this game. I’m out

OoOOoOo stay muzzled up wearing a mask and afraid to live your one life on earth you peasants!!!! Fear!!!!
K, so end of Sept beginning of Oct wasn’t good enough?
I hate when people use “points” to say how much the indexes moved. It’s not fucking consistent. 500 points on the Dow does not mean what it did 6 months ago when the Dow was lower. Just use fucking percents like a normal person. Then it’s consistent no matter what the base value is

You should do some research. Elon is as much an engineer as anyone at Tesla or space X. I worked for a company that supplied apparel for Tesla engineers and was able to see where they worked/played.

Spicy take lol not every business degree is created equal, and just because you have a business administration degree, doesn't mean you get a successful career. Same with finance, same with accounting, etc. Comm majors can make 100k, or they can make 30k. Huge salary variances among business degrees, imo.

I bought puts, you’re welcome bulls, +10% EOD with my luck.
[deleted]
Bears absolutely extinct.
Probably not, but that fee is nuts.
Shit to assert dominance
Abt to approach new highs AGAIN during lunch time. Oh mama 💪🏻🚀
wrong, we here
Wait product managers and program managers Dont do any coding in tech companies and get paid 6 figures. Why are more people not going for these roles? Lol
Just did.  Was waiting until we got close to 442
You pay 4000 rent huh?
Better be deep in the money. The market will retardify the rest of the day, theta killiing anything close to the money.
no is not gona squeeze
I heard the coke there sucks
Whenever I see more than one WSB post saying “recession canceled” that’s my buy signal for puts
And now I have glass in my foot
Damn I did a fart and think the neighbors heard me 


Them bitches :/
You probably don’t even understand a thing about what happened w GME LOL
Volume at half the previous candle this is how you get trapped
Is it too much to ask for SpY to go to 450 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ i mean wtf
Bend over bears here comes the 🚀

Didn't buy options in awhile 

Bought NEGG .13 15c exp 10/15

Just based on a passing comment I saw reading the comment section 

It's like throwing a good lunch money to the wind. Why am I like this??
Thank you for the equivalent of a month's rent, SPY. Cheers

**/u/SilkyThighs** bet **SPY** goes from **441.87** to **450.0** within **1 week**
Domo certified-stocktwat san lol
We should all short one stock and make it Micheal Burrry Bear Natural Reserve
You're right by the way, if I trade options 90% of the time I'll trade narrow spread vertical spreads (credit or debit are mathematically the same thing with narrow spreads too).
They're always cocky until they get cucked
!banbet SPY 450 1w
Spy about to drop a few dollars?
Yes.
RKLB is heavily shorted holy fk that short borrow fee like 230% bruhhhhhh
What why
Ask GME about that one
Buy puts now, thank me later
I need to fuck with selling far OTM options, probably on meme stocks. Scared of getting fuckex with naked call sells though

Yolo on OCGN goodbye paycheck 😎
Bears dead af
I’d like to formally apologize to u/axemanfromma you actually might be onto something. If we hit 450 tomorrow I deserve to have the flair “PELOSI BEST TRADER ALIVE.”
GTLB looks like it’s up 22% but that’s over the reference price of 77. Its actual debut price was 94.23.
There's so many bears in here haha. Betting on a market crash while you could be making money on the way up to new ATH is retarded. Stop it.
Are you a bear? I just got totally fukd today listening to bears
$PSFE (PaySafe)
The sad thing is people who follow Zack Morris and Will Meade on twitter and are fast and sell right away are doing better than anyone on this chat lol
UPSTART BABYYYYYYY
I’m regretting not buying those Spy 440c….
You're bent out of shape that the government is hiding some vague """technology""" from you and your references are a Hyundai that closed preorders on an EV and a 2019 VW Diesel (that doesn't even have keyless start) are somehow "indefinitely reliable." You absolute nutjob, I love it.
Every day I think "it's going to pull back" and every day it says "FOH with that noise I'm ripping another 5%".
Yall really be buying calls at the top and puts at the bott9m

Goddamn, lose that yeeyee ass portfolio and get some gains on your dick, for real

Shake my smh my head 😓😓😓💯
Yeah I love it. Fuck Chicago cops. So fucking lazy. They sit in the nice parts of town while the bad parts are free to do whatever. I get why. Trying to protect the tourist parts. But I still don’t like them.
Market is bouncing back hard and fast, hope you all bought the dip.
Whoever bought upstart puts RIP your soul is about to be dead and burried deep inside the earth
washed my cucumber with dish soap like an idiiot and no matter how much I wash it with water now it tastes like soap.
ShOrT LadDeR AtTaCkS!!!
PLUG finna end up in the green
This is where you buy your earnings season SPY puts. Right now with SPY trading at 442
Bears can’t bring the market down bc they just buy puts and pray 

You have to have shares to actually sell to move the price lmfaoooo
My six year old just said "ber r fuk" omg I'm gonna cry, he's becoming a man so fastly
That engine is lauded for its efficiency more than its reliability, but it can easily outlast 125Mm. Diesel engines in general outlast their warranties because their warranties get lowballed due to potential issues with fuel supply inconsistency. That engine is nothing special for diesel reliability though, not more reliable than some of the piece of shit diesels you can still get in the US, but it gets way better gas mileage and it's just cool. 

And no, I don't believe technology is magic you fucking retard. What's your job, cleaning test pilot vomit out of cockpits with your tongue?

I have 15 444c 10/22 tempted to sell and shift into puts before market close, because I can't imagine market continues to climb after today.
lol which way
What’s up next
i got good news, you're fired.

i thought you said it was good news.

not for you
The second revelation is that you can sell options instead of buying them and actually make money.
Bank earnings are fake and gay. Retail gonna cuck the market.

UPST thats my song turn it up
Hand on the mouse, hovering over the "Close Trade" button, like cowboys facing off in the Old Wild West.
I think a viable strategy is to just buy established cloud stocks whenever you have the cash or, to be more conservative, during down days.. NET, CRWD, UPST, ZS, etc. all retardedly strong. They're expensive though at a minimum about 120 per share.
This feels like a massive bull trap for tomorrow. Everyone buying FDs before the rug pull. I'll wait for another red day before I buy calls again. I got trust issues with the market now 😤
Anyone here from Chicago? Seems like it’s going to be the hunger games this weekend if the police vaccine mandate stays in place
Turns out, you can buy options in non meme stocks and actually make money

Love this SOXL volatility.  Buy calls every single time it dips.  It is almost always followed by +6-8% days.
Yeah I was bag holding qqq calls cause of the flat week.

Was hoping for a big day and got it.  Now to hold and turn it back into bags
Big green dildos everywhere!
Don't know but all this butthole talk on the other sub 

Makes me want to bang a 🍩 right up a girls cooch 😛


GME CANT BE STOPPED!!!!!!!
I was being slightly sarcastic. If it were me and I was up 10%, I’d take the win and move on to the next thing. Meme stocks have no rhyme or reason. It might dump 10% in the next few hrs. Who knows.
Don’t be sleepin while RKT is creepin

Meant to set up a stop loss sell on my BB calls and accidentally sold them. 😭
Not cash gang, just not buying new calls or shares because if I did they would go down
I think I read that it's because they use about 1/3 of the amount as the moderna vax. I got moderna and didn't have much side effects other than some fatigue and a sore arm
Bought Amgen here and bought the lucd IPO dip at 11.15
better stop being greedy before your portfolio gets macked 🤣
Holy shit what happened? It’s at ipo price
Bought SPY calls so prepare yourselves guys, it will surely tank today, or at close, or tomorrow morning, or close tomorrow, or next week, the week after, the month after, the year after, just warning you.

They were up 0.9%

where VW offers a 125,000 km warranty in India. [Source.](https://www.volkswagen.co.in/idhub/content/dam/onehub_pkw/importers/in/pdf/extended-warranty-price-list.pdf) Warranties are limited to when the manufacturer themselves predicts that maintenance costs outweigh their cost to maintain, because it becomes... *unreliable* haha

Do you seriously believe that cars outside of the US have these secret """technologies""" that make them magically more reliable than those in the US? Hell, most of the assembly is sourced from the same suppliers and ran on the same tolerances. Its a Volkswagen diesel, there's literally nothing remarkable about this car ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)

Lately notice that a runup is happening before the actual news breaks.  Like people know the news already, whether its an innovation, expansion, big earnings, whatever, but then when news breaks the stock actually goes down or moves very little.  This might be the run now

PLTR for example.  28 a week before the big contract announcement.  Down ever since the  big news
Come on 442 just the tip 👌

This week teaches a valuable lesson. Greedy 🐻 get fucked and buy the fucking dip.
I usually buy on red days and hold until it goes up around 40% to exit. Not the best at shorting (and seems risky while we're on a massive bull run since march 2020) so I can use a few pointers on that based on global markets as I didn't major in economics. Thanks for all the pointers!

Not saying it's right or wrong, just a different underlying risk profile.
UNFI has made me more money this year than any stock in my portfolio. So predictive. Leaps huge after they beat earnings then finds a floor for a few months. Small run up to earnings, beat, and spike. 

550 shares @avg entry of $24.

Gonna be sideways between 44 and 46 until next earnings. $60 eoy.
Couldn’t be me dawg
So buying at the top or very near it?

Might be overdone, but until investors believe Chinese investments are safe from interference by the Chinese government, not likely to get back to normal prices.
So that was you I saw yesterday, I saw someone flip off a mask driver during a traffic stop. Did u cry when you got home?

True lol
I work on eVTOLs for a living ya dunce. You're using the phrase "indefinitely reliable" but admit that someone still has to maintain it--guess what, that means its not indefinitely reliable.

So you're saying that the Ioniq lacks the features you want, but you're also being stopped from buying it, even though it doesn't have what you want in it. Am I getting that right?

Or did you just not have enough money for a preorder?

I use a ridiculous amount of TA, monitor all global markets like china, Japan, european markets etc. Early september had a giant triple negative divergence form on RSI and other indicators, was a great short entry.

I’m certainly no bear either but I definitely just bought some inverse ETF calls to cover my ass for the 2nd half of today and tomorrow.
Florida has been having a ton of foreclosures and evictions, lol. Been looking at buying up a nice future AirBnB(s).

Following what you said on inspection, yeah. The houses, especially apartments and condos are trash.
You can avoid inflation by simply not buying anything. Other than options of course.

Anyone looking at vita coco or stronghold?
Oh wow

Up a whopping .45 cents
Lol every time man. At least you made money
Why are you mad the person you sold your calls to also gets to make some money
UPST (currently at $370) looks like it wants to go on another $200 tear from its base at $290 up to $490 just like it went from $130 to $330 from early August to late September.

I'm not taking any position either way, but the stock looks like it's just going to keep attracting momentum buyers until/unless it fails at some point.

Maybe if it gets to $490-500, I'll buy puts lol...; otherwise probably not touching it.

Really similar price action to TSLA last year...

Even though the numbers of foreclosures are small, they are starting to happen in the states most have moved to during the past 2 years. If these numbers start approaching 50-60k by Jan 2022 I see some real issues starting. Especially since many of these homes were bought without proper inspection and top price was paid.

RIOT the coin miner that doubled total number of it's coin holding last quarter and value of it's coins doubled in the quarter to $250 million and increasing.  So, it's holding worth 4 times than previous quarter. However the stock price was pushed down as much as possible.  Now is starting to move higher.  It should go above its high of $75 soon. There is also investors yearly meeting on Tuesday  and they will display their new mining facilities and talk about thousands of new miners added this quarter.

Has anybody been following NET and FSLY the past couple months; trying to figure out why FSLY has fallen so far behind NET on a relative basis.  I know FSLY got tons of hype here 2 years ago and then at the start of the pandemic and approached a near 1:1 valuation, but now NET is worth 10x as much as FSLY. 

Pre-pandemic NET was worth around 2x as much as FSLY, so that's a decent baseline.  But now it's like only NET is a winner.

My hypothesis for the rest of day &amp; next? Continue to go up to stomp majority of puts &amp; consolidate to trap calls for tomorrow. Monday huge sell off if close to ATH is reached before sometime tomorrow. If close to ATH is not reached, continued volatility but with spy trending majority to the upside then sell off 2-4weeks out

This is what I hate about the bulls. The entirety of their up moves is like 2 fucking days of 2% green every time. Then everything else is flat low volume bullshit days
A stalwart company. More of a service provider, at least in CA I have seen, probably a delay from producers drilling to seeing them rise? Looking for something that moves a little more %

Few months ago I came on here and advertised ENLC &amp; someone said “I think you mean the other way round” (CLNE). I said come back to me in a few months. Lovely jump from $5, still shooting up, hop on or get left behind 🚀
So you're basically praying for jpow to die over night
Ok bagholder
Yeah I’m delusional. Not you thinking anyone cares what you have to say😂 imagine being so narcissistic. You are a nobody, bro. Truly

Why is OCGN rallying? Any news or random noise?
[deleted]
I didn't mean a vehicle someone like you can rely on indefinitely, if you are too retarded to do maintenance. I meant something people like me, who aren't too retarded to do maintenance, can rely on indefinitely. 

And I already did name one particular vehicle the government is supposedly blocking from me, the Ioniq 5. Remember, this whole conversation started with me being mad about the deep state making sure the Ioniq 5 would be fucked up so that I can't benefit from any of the technology in it? Try to keep up even with your tiny brain capacity, otherwise it's not really worth having a conversation with you. I'm already dumbing shit down for you as much as I can
I say somewhere between that and 441.70
10/20
At $2 bucks profit a share you’d had to buy $100k worth to make anything
OCGN 🚀 anything under $10.50 is a decent entry. Don’t be the one chasing this thing
INTC LMAOOO KEEP GOIN
Hope so. Call option volume bumping too.

I am not even bear but bulls are kinda retarded thinking one Green Day means the bearish momentum of 3 months  is gone

Upst is already at tesla level retarded valuation, why do you think it has any more room to run?
Does a 40% portfolio loss make me more attractive?!?
IONQ and quantum computing is holy grail of the entire technology industry. Could be a long term cult stonk like TSLA but WSB too retarded to understand benefits of QC.
I tried getting into that show Billions. Too unrealistic…like you can just go short a company having problems and make money lmao. That’s how normies think it works I guess
You already have an active bet, get out of here nerd.
Or you can have bought them at 441 and had to watch them just climb back to even today 🤡 at least it’s not a huge loss anymore

UPST will probably run one more time, maybe to $400, and then probably dump. AFRM is ripe to dump; there’s a huge gap in the channel since exploding on the 6th.

Ohh hell yeah I even bought more so I could sell more CCs last few months. OCGN is a god damn money train tbh
I love when an option chain has strikes all up a range of like +30% to +60% but the one strike in the middle is +0% which is obv the strike with the owned contracts.

So glad I held out for all these months
You said that there are EVs in Scandinavia that are "indefinitely reliable." Name one that won't need maintenance, just as any in the US would also need. If it needs replacement batteries *ever*, its not indefinitely reliable. Just name one if you're so confident they exist lmao

You're so bent out of shape about vague "they won't let us have the good EVs!!!" but you can't even name a particular vehicle that the government is supposedly blocking from you. You fell for social media hype and when reality didn't meet your warped fantasy, you have to claim that its a government conspiracy.

Bold move. How should I hedge that with a put?
Bought WBA this morning, 250 more shares, while a bunch of idiots were bailing out. Lo and behold, it bounces off the morning low of $45.23 and it's eyeing $50. I sold my 250 shares but I'm long WBA with a much more sizeable position because I like the stock and love the dividend. Gotta love the volatility on this one and quadruple volume average volume.

I hope SDC found it's floor. I'm in

SPY looks like it’s just gonna crash and we are gonna have another 3 day red 😂 but it’s too early to buy puts and it’s getting dangerous for call holders because it can go down any second. I will look into puts EOD or tomorrow because Friday usually takes a shit EOD
Reloaded puts too early it seems

I made nice gains on my calls but I myself don’t feel safe  holding. I took my gains and exited quickly at open. Spy is a dangerous girl to play with
[Here's a decent analysis of several with back tests](https://towardsdatascience.com/does-technical-analysis-work-heres-proof-a2b626a3fbe9)

Technical indicators over a long enough time period should actually be inversed for stocks, but have positive (but degrading) returns on crapto. But once you factor in transaction costs and bid/ask slippage, there is zero alpha.
Anyone ever bust a nut so hard that it hurt for a whole day?

50% in 2 weeks is still an incredible gain! You still made out on top even if you sold CC for it so be proud of yourself :) It sounds like you're in a stable place so hope it doesn't get you down too much.

No you can close them all at once, just select the ones you want to close together and close. It calculates everything properly. 

just click "trade options" and manually select all legs u want to close together.
Alright so here's how we wipe out WSB men/and ladies. Go back to March 2020. Look at the steady climb before the drop. Look at the top again. Do u see how there's a double top? Once they realize how bad the situation is they pump it to ath 1 more time to completely drain the market. Then u should buy stocks again.
If you don't have TQQQ leaps what are you even doing with your life?
They are making a lot of money. And CNBC hasn’t shut up about them for the past month.. plus motley fool listed it as a buy now last month.

Fine dipshit, then here are your choices. Either there is **NO VEHICLE** that has **ANY CHANCE** of surviving whatever you think is gonna happen, or you think there's bound to be some shit that kills everything electrical in which case the vehicle you'd want would be **one with a good diesel engine.**

#Funny how this brings us to the actual second item on my list of features I'm fucking done with you idiots not letting me have in the US

#First was an electric platform you can rely on indefinitely 

#Second is A DIESEL ENGINE WORTH A SHIT 

#I've been pissed about this one for years. Way longer than the electric platform issue.

Electric car technology has come so far at this point I'm more pissed I can't have a good electric car than I am I can't have a good diesel, but before electric car technology was this good I was already fucking pissed Uncle Sam won't let me buy any diesel vehicle that isn't decades old because they all had to put computer bullshit in them for the US market. How the fuck did you not know about any of this? Electric cars have been good for years and I don't even know how many years this was the #1 issue on my list before electric cars got good enough to overtake it.

I have purchased a large bottle of Nair to get hairless legs and a used white 2019 BMW M4, so I can continue your regularly anticipated gayposts

I will also be switching from drinking straight whiskey like I normally do, to drinking whatever fruity concoctions "Dat Homie Steve" enjoys
11/19 so we will see.  50% in 2 weeks, green every single day.  Seems impossible.  Second time I've been bitten, rode NET up 65-90 but sold CCs for 90 and missed 90-$110 before jumping back in.  Should learn my lesson to not do that on NET.  Oops.
Goddamn i missed the biggest bull run of october
I’m a contractor for Wendys and I have a full time job with a Fintech
Why?
Somebody REALLY doesn't want LTCH to close above $11 today or tomorrow....
Reminder: JPow already announced the taper 🖨️📴

That's been their whole business model for decades. Provide cheap labor for IP.
I want to buy Tesla call but v expensive.  Help me i m poor
The calls I sold  to close for even yesterday are up almost 300% today.
It's not so much a dollar amount.  But when I can start my own space company, I think I will have made it.
Looking this fucking trap....
I don't think I've ever disliked a government official as much as Yellen.
I have the same situation except I drink espresso from my own machine and live in the home office during the day. Shit is so cash

Talking about politics all the time is gross 😭 

Wow 240k where do you work bro or what work do you do ?
Ya prolly 100k
Lol
This is why Robinhood is extra retarded



Enter SPY calls (use vast majority of portfolio buying power because….YOLO). Enjoy gains and then convert to a spread by selling contracts with a higher strike price with my owned calls as collateral. 



Next day, SPY moons overnight. My calls have 5x and the ones I sold also 5x. Overall the spreads are profitable (bought calls for $100, now they’re worth $500; sold calls for $80, now they’re worth $400; each spread is worth $100)



Robinhood UI views these as independent trades and not a spread. Because of this you have to close out the legs independently. You also cannot close your bought calls before closing the sold calls because the bought ones are collateral for the sold ones. 




To bring this back full circle, given I YOLOed and thusly had no buying power - I literally couldn’t buy back the sold calls in order to then sell my bought calls and realize the profit. Had to deposit enough money into my account JUST TO CLOSE OUT A WINNING TRADE. 



Ridiculous
Probably shoulda sold $SDC when we were winning ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Depends where you live.
fuckin ban wtf
Retail rich are youtube influencers trying to sell you their shopify courses
Can you imagine the inflation numbers without her?
did UPST discover cure for cancer or something? how is it trading this high.
One day i will learn about stocks that aren't considered memes. Today is not that day.
YIKES. Username checks out lol
Glad I could unload my emotional trauma on to you.  Share and share alike, I always say.
You can ignore it, buy puts against it, or buy calls. SPY goes up all the way anyways. SPY is worth $1500 minimum retards, buy calls.
I have the same question
😂😂
prob 5 mil+ liquid

not quite there but maybe in 5-10 years.
True but when you search for sdc it’s the top post
Let’s hope so
I got 440P 10/15 lol. I think there's a good chance we see 439 again today. That's a good enough exit point
My dick hurt
Got some Leaps strike 17
I don’t know… I’m a bull but somewhere I’m gonna ride it down with puts
CBOE bro
I already have a banbet that AMZN will hit 3400
They got the bills, close enough, right?
Yeah, I think there will be steady growth over the next couple of months.

An underpaid Guyanese woman is cleaning my filthy apartment while I sit here at Starbucks shitposting on Reddit and day trading FD’s
$700 minimum.
Bought SPY put 440 expired 10/18 price 1.75

I think tomorrow SPY will go down because of Friday.
Is SENS ever going to release and rocket? I'm sitting at like 20% up so I'm not bag holding but I'd love it to go parabolic.
#I am not your friend hot tub boy.
Okay folks so it looks like we’re gonna rally all the way into the recession …..Ratt N’ Roll!
Cramer needs to keep Sofi’s name out of his mouth. As soon as he starts yelling to boomers about a stock, quick drop.
Congrats! Stay above water, my friend :)
Maybe it'll do what it did yesterday and start climbing back up after noon... Now would be good too
I'll never understand how SWBI isn't at least $30
How much money do you need to consider yourself “rich”
They will not stop buying until every put is turned into ash
and back down we go!
MVST printing. Offload those bags while you can!
Godspeed. If Remy doesn't wanna live on skreets there's always room in my pack for him.
It’s the anonymous friends we made along the way that count
WSB buys the other 5%
So I been putting half of my money aside to prepare for a market crash. And exactly WHEN will market crash???
Is SPY still gonna go up tm?
only $4 more to go and I'm good!
Ocgn $10 wall is enormous lmao
I imagine more people into ass succeed more than tit people?
By tomorrow itll be around 160. Enough for me to buy a 162.5 P
How are none of the New York teams the bulls, Chicago has bulls and bears...
$SOFI SO FLY!  


I think the market is going to still remain sideways for a bit but we're going to see a short term bounce up from these levels heading into the holiday season. I can see a dip next February/March. It's looking like the early stages of the Santa Claus rally.  


Now if that bank charter can come in leading up to SOFI earnings that would be a real early Christmas present.   


Keep your eye on $DKNG  


There's still that rumor of them partnering with ESPN that is flying under the radar.
If OCGN goes over 10 I’ll leave my girlfriend and go back to my wife
Tsla has been strong as of late, I think we’ll see 900 before we see &lt; 800
Ya I ate my put losses we mooning
We should remove memes from this sub 

Every fucking post is memes 

The rest of reddit is fucking memes do we need it here too? Same recycled shit
I think you have to "fuck the bears" if you lose this...

Did you ask permission? Lol
Let’s go OCGN! Get that double digits
Bruh, I fucking need SPY at 449 tomorrow to break even. Haha ok.

Good think I bought itm so it won't be worthless, but still looking at losing $8K on this.
You can try to find some bears to fuck in the woods, gives ya something to do while you're banned
I wouldn't. But I lost my ass doing that before. Don't underestimate the pizza lord.
Thanks boo!
Something is up with $SKLZ. I like it.
If you still practice with iron from time to time it's OK to buy another. You can try red but green is preferable.
Has anyone done a study on the historical success rate for different TA patterns? It would be interesting to see what the success rates are
Time to buy more bags I guess ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)

i cant think of any upcoming announcements so if you dont see any better plays i guess holding is fine
do. not. chase.
Lose a banbet on purpose it’ll be good for you
Take the money and run my dude
Was holding root calls all week, sold ‘‘em at 5.25 for a 9% profit smh
I fukin quit. Fuk you clov
My mistake, you’re doing the best you can and people don’t know the rules.
Does anyone else not get a fill that you try to get right before close then feel that sweet relief when your play would have been fucked at open 😮‍💨

**/u/0zOvOx0** bet **SPY** goes from **441.0** to **450.0** within **2 days** **

fuck the bears**
[deleted]
That's actually how I run naked SPY options, on days I actually care to risk losing money.
It's a J200 with the UR-3FE, not saying it's ideal but it's quiet at 76 mph, it's comfortable, the sound system is dope, and if I get a wild hair it will jack the front up 11 inches and climb a rocky 45 degree slope.  They did cancel it last year, next one will be a shake-apart-at-60K twin turbo POS.

You must not be an American after all, the diesel Hiluxes are only available overseas.
I'd sell the calls given the huge premium increase today tbh (depending on the expiry)
!banbet SPY 450 2d

Lol tell me about it. SPY calls are not the play everyday, just when things seem like they can only get worse. Was expecting a severe gap down on the FOMC minutes release and now we got this crazy gap up day. Insane.
See you tonight for futures.
I’m in DC from NYC and it’s not as fun when everyone wants to talk about politics. I make $240k 29yr
at 56% profit on this short TSLA 680p. Take profit like a good little theta gang boy or ride it out saying no chance we hit 680 in 1 more week?
Oof when is your exp? It still might dip after its long run..
I'll be your friend. At least you'll have that.
That’s the right way to do it ha
UPRO/TMF /r/HFEA style. Adjust ratios as you see fit.
Ngl, both bears *and* bulls acting sus af right now.

I don't trust any of you enough to even inverse you.

LOL
Just adding to their misery
You mean horse futures, ain’t no rib meat in that thing.
LOL so true it’s all I can do to trade once a year on there….
Guys, I think the bears might be upset.
Was holding puts and bought more today
I didn't but sold 155 CCs a week ago after big green for a week and those are already so fucked.
Tbh no, but it looks cool.
Which would You hold overnight and which would you sell? spy 443c  or coin 252.50 expiring tomorrow?
Be honest with yourself, do you really need either?
I do
It’s not “this place” it’s the market….easy to make money with things climbing up from the pandemic.

This is the confirmation by bias I was looking for
A Land Cruiser old enough to be worth a shit mechanically isn't safe on the Mad Max Fury Roads the overlords have implemented in 21st century America. 

A Land Cruiser new enough to be remotely safe ish on American roads is too far into the deep state's sabotage of diesel vehicles in the US for the engine to actually be trustworthy. 

I'm still fucking pissed if I was in pretty much any other country on Earth I could buy cars that are actually worth buying but instead I live in the US so all I can do is try my best to find the cheapest cars possible to get fucked the smallest amount possible and it's a constant enraging struggle instead of a convenient utility or something I can enjoy
Bears love to double down when we’re an hour &amp; half into trading lmaoo

Anyone here like weed stocks? 🚀
Especially since everyone rolled into that the last few weeks, could be a huge rug pull
Did you buy the puts to back it? They may print, but I'm not sure of anything 4 weeks out in this market.
Last time SPY did this it gapped back down the following week. Take profits and don't get rekted...
After the squeeze is squoze they will come back.

So I’ve never used a red optic before, but my green Holosun dot is starbursting. Should I buy a red one for my other gun to try out red?
when i stopped trading as a way to try to make money i became much more content

i just trade to try and win now. the money i make or lose doesn't make much of a difference, it's just more or less money to trade with so i'm not any better or worse off.

sometimes i make big losses and have to take a break from trading since i have no money to do it anymore, one day it would be cool to make a killing and actually improve my situation, but that's not necessarily my goal yet
Sofi is acting like such a bundle of sticks right now.

So uh, how does Shopify have less than 350k volume? I looked at history and it seems 500-600k is generally the highest average (notice I said average) for shopify, yet I recall tons of retail, rich, and institutions proping it up, but it seems at least within the last (full 365) year it hasnt been very liquid with relatively low volume for it's share price and mindshare.

Severely low volume, it'll pick up later today but not by a major amount.

There's also some nobody stocks up a good deal today too, with worthless out the money options being 4-5 dollars each while the near money options are .15-60 cents each. Likely gatekeeper bots.

I smell fish, and it's in a can.
I've found being patient and just waiting for confirmation of trend change / holds has been more profitable than thinking "too high, must go down vice verse" - follow the main trend and even if you get the minor direction wrong, you can always average down and get back to where you need to be. Unless you bought the top or bottom, then just GTFO and minimize losses
PSFE going crazy…join us!!!
BBBY going back to $7. Imagine buying that shit above 20 last year

What happens when there is nothing left for the Chinese economy to steal or copy from others? I keep seeing "China leading..." this or that, what exactly are the leading? Have they actually innovated anything? Seems like an economy built on copying, not innovating, will hit a brick wall at some point.
It'll course correct soon. nows the time to buy calls
If we can do this tomorrow, my god my portfolio will be back. I hate you bears so much &gt;:|

Sometimes it just feels like shit to trade. Who cares if I made 3k in a day if I’m down 20k on the year. Im still down 17k at the end of the day. 

At this point it’s like, I just would’ve been WAY better off if I never traded. I wasted so much time, effort, terrible work management ethics just to lose 17k total so earning 3k in a day is like lol. 

Contract isn’t being renewed, time wasted, ate a bunch of junk, eating disorder, machine learning is hard as fuck. It’s like I would’ve saved so much time and I would’ve had a used car or some bullshit. Like fucj man. Oh and also being a degen swiping tinder all the time lol

Yeah, I dumped my calls when it broke over 250. My guess is the open interest on the 250c for tomorrow is going to keep it pinned under that until next week.

It's called loss aversion. Normal human reaction, but something you need to learn to control cuz that's how you start bagholding instead of cutting losses early.
Take gains in low tier memes early, and everyone will flock to the best memes. Than we pump and dump again

You made a really short custom ban bet (None) which was not accepted.
Don't put any text after the time token (1m, 1w, 15d) if you don't intend to carry out an interesting punishment to get unbanned early.
I feel like the moment I capitulate SPY will cool off a little.
75 million shares short over at OCGN… look at them covering LOL
How does making some amount of money make you want to die? I'm sure I could make way more money than you and still want to live forever and still want to be able to drive around forever. For all we know I might already be making more money than you and still don't want to die. Or wait, are you saying once you make a certain amount of money you lose the ability to understand that time is passing and society is collapsing? Sorry, still not buying it, I'm sure I could make way more money than you and still understand that society is collapsing and cars that don't last long won't last long. I think you have to stop blaming your money for fucking up your brain and look inward to ask yourself why you're really so retarded
You think da coin gets to 100k soon? THATD be crazy

Hey check the five year on SPY and tell me the general trend
probably out of shame that they didn't do what most people did; buy calls the day of the pump, sell next day and buy puts.  Free money.
I bet against bonds and realized how retarded I was on Tuesday, then I went all in in calls later that day. However, my ban bet is still on and I will probably be banned next week. 😂
I think spy puts is a good move right now. Look for a couple dollar drop.

Imagine buying a new car every few years and not even building up a collection because every car you buy is some dumbass piece of shit that can't even go 200,000 miles. Now add onto this that you're so dumb you don't even know well-made well-maintained cars break a million miles easily. Then imagine to top it all off you're so butthurt and insecure about your delusions that when you hear something like that you just assume it's a lie, refuse to look it up, and keep believing no car has ever gone a million miles on the original engine even though you have come across the information and you had internet access to fact check it.
I'm buying SDC now bc I know it'll follow AMC and GME soon - same thing happens every time those run, all the most recent WSB stocks start running. SDC to $20 by the end of this month is my prediction

Been a while since we've had a real bull day like this. Like, sometimes SPY and QQQ are up but everything else just lingers.

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
yeah looks like BB is up 6% to the others 2%
This gets insanely complicated pretty quickly if you want to get into it but trying to keep the brakes on and keep it simple: there are problems with importing that a model actually being available in the US would solve, and I'm extremely pissed that everyone else's stupidity holds me back from getting an optimal solution to a problem just because they're a bunch of retarded dickheads who can't handle letting anything work quite right in anyone's life because it makes them too butthurt and insecure.

If you're poor and you're envious of rich people, bewarned you cannot escape your envy just by getting money.

My envy went from rich Americans to Europoors.

A full on bull day makes my shoulder tension relax. It's been a long time since I've seen +20k on a day.

Jumping into UPST for some daytrades and weeklies. Last run I just watched it go, always thinking "today was the top", and for like a solid month it never was. Not expecting the same huge run, but stop losses in place, probably good for a couple trades.
I always assume we're finishing flat since that's usually the way.

This time I put all of my SPY gains in BIDU and JD, it's a washout

Max pain
Definitely could keep going up. Not sure how it has a good six months with tapering and interest rates rising after that. But I can see that happening as well because that’s what the market does. Goes up.
Had 110-114 TSM spreads that I closed at open for $3.60. Still sitting on higher strikes for EOM, but feeling good about closing for profit for once.

You made a really short custom ban bet (None) which was not accepted.
Don't put any text after the time token (1m, 1w, 15d) if you don't intend to carry out an interesting punishment to get unbanned early.

MMs know the mob is backing up the truck right now. The OPEX dump is next week….
This guy, fucking legend!
I can’t think of a single thing I hate more than the “ape” movement. I have literally stopped gambling on GME since there is just no physical, logical way that this many asinine retards could ever be right about anything.
Happy I bought CRSP at 93 yesterday. Anyone in medicine knows it will only go up.
Why are my stocks sideways on a green day????
If SPY doesn't get above 442 Bulls are gonna get mega fucked by OPEX tomorrow

for those of you who are using google authenticator for your trading accounts, i suggest you switch to another method of 2 factor authentication asap. was using google authenticator and got totally fucked over because they don't store your master passwords in the cloud. bricked my phone and couldn't get anything off it, now i have to call in tech support with all the accounts i was using it with. would literally rather have all my money stolen than get cucked by some retard at google who thought it was a good idea to make sure all your passwords go poof if anything ever happens to your phone.

Potentially dumb question but I just sold a shit ton on CSPs on DNA at $9 for 10/15. Filled at 5$ per contract and 5 minutes later the price is 1$ per contract. I want to buy to close but the minimum ask I can put in is $0.05. How do I know what the order will fill at. There are no bids and 440 asks at $0.05
How much higher can upst go and why? Jesus they have been killing it the whole year

I've got a tingling feeling in my balls that there will be a bit of a downie on SPY in a little bit, but I also don't feel confident enough in my pubic crabs to put money on it
Tell you hand we say hi
I had a bunch of shares when it was $25. Definitely one of my biggest misses, up there with some GME calls I sold right before it mooned.
I have a love/hate relationship with options…

I spend all day staring and obsessing at the tiniest movements in stock price… yet the amount of money i make/lose from that tiny movement is amazing
I keep telling myself it'll stop ripping as soon as i buy in. 6 weeks later, shit still going up
I will never financially recover from this

u ok? u sound upset
Scared ass bears wish for a market crash because they see all the faults in today's markets and think they'll have a better chance when things are "fair" and "realistic"

Lol you think your bear ass would do any better in a bear market scenario you scaredy pansy?? There's a reason why nobody posts put options gains on this sub, that's because you paper-hand before they're profitable

Bears, stick to your "essential" wage jobs and stop dreaming of a world in which your scared ass gets to enjoy any resource plentitude, because it's never happening with the level of fear emotion on which you operate DAILY

In every single conceivable scenario from outright apocalyptic to commie utopian, your money and resource security gets TOOK by those with more emotional fortitude and mental stability

UPST up 17.5% in the last 5 days. fucking ridiculous stock
TSM beats earnings (in the middle of a global chip shortage, so of course there was no reason for it to have tanked so hard in the first place) and it goes up on the European markets almost 5%. Wall Street opens and of course it tanks. North American markets are such a fucking clown show 🤡, completely detached from fundamentals. Change my mind.
Reversion to the mean, guys. I’m feeling a SPY swing back down to 432 today. or at least i hope so cuz I am effed otherwise. My spreads look like dirty butthole.

I don’t understand how Facebook can be so shit for so long like we just tested the 200 dma
Walgreens partnering with CLOV
TWLO 320 to 360 in a matter of 2-3 days! Wow 😯
Honestly
The Meek Shall Inherit
Baba if you don’t rocket, I will put a rocket in you.
That was AH and PM and a lil at open I’m talking the full day
I also think SPY will close up around 99%
🚀🚀🚀
We are definitely in a bubble but i can’t stop buying
I’m down 25% and holding because I don’t want to admit the loss I feel you brother it’s a great company but our markets are as crooked as an Englishman’s teeth
SOFI and CLOV, come get my bags, please and thank you.
Market is up 1.5%, I’m down 0.5%.
Well, the uptrend in oil is real, though in close perspetive one could think of appearence of several negative drivers, like lift of Iran sanctions, quarantine in China, OPEC decision to rise the supply, etc. I would hold, but not whether this position is my entire possessions.
You realize I eat ass right
Got my 20%. Yall have fun.
Next tuesdsy
434.88
Monday
because chikenbeer said so?
I told y’all APPL calls Wednesday at the bell we’re the play, it could keep running up tomorrow but definitely today.

Monday morning grab APPL puts, sell em the same day just later on in the afternoon.

How can your portfolio rise 20% in a day?
So…nothing.  Typical WSB
Slept in to see PLUG go from 35 to 32 at open…. Holding 34 c…..

This aged so poorly so quickly wow
I’ve been sitting on a position with a 10k(-60%) loss going on 7 months now. I wanna sell it in the worst way but I can’t bring myself to do it. Longest I’ve ridden a loss

Fucking OI on the 250c is going to keep SQ pinned today.
Think I’m waiting to see if this hits 441 first but yeah puts incoming
Ya for me it's fucking NET.  Ya made a ton but who imagined 50% rise in 2 weeks.  $155 CCs are dead.  Second time that happened to me with NET, sold $100s a few months ago and it didn't stop from $65-$115.  Oops.
I bought some plug calls. Hope I’m not retarded
It’s staying 439 all day
Bwaaahahah he said democracy. 
Unfortunately we are loosing that, decipher the word..demo - democrats / cracy - crazy

WSB members now it’s time to ride CLOV
Lemme hold $10,000 real quick
Thats a riperino. If you get 1 a piece selling you'll be lucky.
Buy to close
What's worse?  Buying a stock at 10 and holding as it becomes a penny stock, or buying a stock at 10, selling and 12, and watching it moon to 250?
NET puts seem like such an obvious play
It’s time for Tilray to have a huge day

thats why you don't put all your chips into 1 position, you need more outs. If your going to swing trade try puting 1% of portfolio in 100 different positions and then selling after a month.
If you are not making a shit ton of money with all the green today you need to give up you are terrible and will never be good at this.

just lol
I feel this.  There's definitely a certain amount of faith that is required to go long with shares, I guess you have to believe that eventually everything does revert to the mean and fundamentals do matter in the long run.  Reading some of Buffett and Lynch's books where they describe previous markets that felt a lot like this, and the eventual outcomes, is insightful.  People ahve been saying value investing is dead since the 50's, and eventually they are all proven wrong in the long run.  The long run potentially being a decade-plus.

Fuck the car. How’s the dog?
I cashed out again… gambling addiction is real.  Don’t screw up your lives.  Force yourself to go to the sidelines.  Market will still be there when you get back.
Is there a bigger, more bottomless hole to lose your money then VXX? If so, I haven't found it. It's my own personal Mariana trench.

THIS MAN PEES SITTING DOWN
Always fun watching your shit crater while market is big green.  Except for the stuff you sold CCs on which of course just goes up and up.
Weak how?
If the IRS starts getting notified of transactions over $600, they will have to hire as many agents as the population of Burma just to process all the info from just the retards on WSB...
Hopefully margin is going to wash out the stinky bear sentiment for a while.

If they can give me a 5-8% discount I’m buying. 30 yr mortgage. Bears living in crack boxes
The market is not zero sum because everyone can be a winner if stocks keep going up. Options on the other hand, are very much zero sum.

#BB GOIN UP
Sold my calls for $750 and bought puts. Done for the day unless it drills.
See you next week
it wasn't a gamble. everyone was buying for the event at 10 AM. obviously would sell off. buy rumor -&gt; sell news

dudes fund underperforms spy by a wide margin and he's on tv giving advice lol. He should just tell people to buy spy every episode, and the entire episode could be him talking about how the experts don't know shit and you should just buy spy
I have the biggest crush on $SoFi
wanna get in this one hopefully i’m not too late if i wait a month or so
Spy downward trend broken maybe?
PSFE INTERGALACTIC

Way oversold imo. FDA put its trials on hold and investigated before it advances to phase 2 as one patient had a chromosomal abnormality. Obviously do your research of course.
Markets been open 18 minutes and it feels like 4 hours
I took profits and sold 90% of my portfolio on this unexpected green day.

What did I miss that they are up 50% in like 5 days
Welp down 98% all time after this morning.  17k in 18 months.  Deleting the RH account after these puts expire worthless tomorrow and never doing this shit again 🤙
$PSFE truckin'
It's a money extravaganza!
I got 2022 calls 1/21/22 $52.5 and 4/14/22 $55. I’m not down really (like 5%) and I’m selling PoorMansCCs on em so I’m really not down at all I guess
Flat for the week 😩 loaded amd calls for next Friday. Probably just not gonna look at the market until Monday. Here’s to hoping Tom Brady wins me some money tonight
Sofi back to its bitch ass ways
WFC such a shit stock
Its so overvalued. I'm just waiting for a pullback like if their systems aren't as secure with some bad news. It's worth $60 imo but the market doesn't think so. I'll be shocked if they even turn a profit this year
BB up 4% apes acting like its mooning 🤣
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azOhW5OEAWQ
Bears told me to buy puts i thought it was free money
Today SPY is a meme, except without the bagholders and downside
On track? It's 15pts off lol.

$AMZN is on track for $4,000 but it won't happen by Friday.
I would’ve opened a position on CLF but my app doesn’t have it. Oh well
Nice gamble
Go Hyliion gang!
don't give me hope.... don't make this a bull trap...
Let me check how my TSLA puts are doing...

Spy 445 end of next week
i'm cursed lol

I could hold a position for weeks/months and it'll go downward or sideways. the moment I exit in an attempt a swing trade expecting a pattern dip, the stock pops. and I mean **the moment**. feels like an algorithm is targeting me specifically man
I loaded up on shares of XOM and RDS.B this time last year when it cratered. All the tech stock bros thought it was a dumb move because EV was obviously taking over within a year or two. Nothing sweeter than getting those fat divys while your position has also doubled in value 🤑🤑
I bought 3 calls for 2024 this feels like a wash out to me

Sorry dude, even as a NET bull I didn't think it'd jump 50% in 2 weeks.  Sold CCs for 155 and those are dead.
Ooooohhh bears are getting it good today

Lol someone unloaded an enormous bag. 439.78 to 439.11 in seconds
Put credit spreads and 14dte calls FTW
Planning on buying longer calls on FB for this earnings season. They are beat the ef down and they'll kill earnings anyway. Morals don't matter when making money.
GME 200C my last hope
Market ripping and im red, shocking I tell you.
$20 EOY. $13 EOW excellent opportunity to double down for me and average up.

Well shorts win on SDC. What a stinker we cannot break $5.88, each time we get there shorts just hit the button over and over. The one setup that is actually really good, and no buyers lol.
Recession cancelled? Back to to stocks only go up?
Bought 15 more shares of ASTS this morning to have an even 1200 shares. And I’m not done buying yet 🤪
Huh?!
Quick question I made money on my Merill lynch &amp; lost a fuck ton of money in robinhood does the money I lost mean I won’t pay taxes? lost like 50k lol
Sold my SPY too soon. 180% isnt cool. 2000% is cool. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
$CLOV BABY CLOVVVVV 👀☘️🍀☘️🚀🚀🚀

nice market
FAKE AND GAY
Sold my $PLUG puts for 300% gain. TBH I think I could have gotten 100% more and it be a 6 bagger but I don't wanna hold all day hoping a stock goes in one direction. 300% in 15 minutes is good enough
If I wanted to watch dumb Jeopardy! shit I'd watch Jeopardy! and not David Faber and this contestant sucking each other's dicks on TV
Did people see the FUD around $sava?  fake news email from NIH.  Pathetic.  These shorts should BURN!!!!
Every time I think I’m smart and take away profit on SPY calls I get screwed over with jumps like these. I could’ve been rich 😭
what a ridiculous 1m candle on spy lmao
I doubt that, people here are still holding WISH,SNDL,CLOV bags that will never make them money
Theta gang robbing

10 straight big green days for NET, so ridiculous
BB. 
I’m sure I’m dreaming. I can actually sell it. At a profit. I could cry. But I won’t.
BB breaks through 10.10 and it’s smooth sailing from there
Paysafe tho
But it’s well on track to hitting $830
You forgot:

Wonder if the symposium is gonna be a dud or just some profit taking
Sold my calls at open for a 115% gain feels good man
Because it expires tomorrow 🤷🏼‍♂️
nothin' but NET
No I limit ordered but I didn't realize the options chain wasn't updating until after I clicked submit, and ToS is so fucking slow I got a TLTC
Just made 4k on some dumb ass spy calls. 

Done for the day. 

Now time to work my wage slave job.

That’s very humorous. You got a real nice Reddit account dere. Would be a shame if something were to happen to it. Capice?
Was so excited to be a Bull again today but had to cop a 438 put for Friday. Honestly looks like it wants to dump. Dunno what the overnight action was for
Ur toast 🥂
I'd hold. But come on man, you shouldnt ask for advice about these things. Its your mind!!!

You're an annoying crazy person.

How the fuck do you think the government isn't involved when EVERY CAR that comes out in the US for a fucking YEAR is marketed only to retards without a single car available for a smart person to buy?

Once you've explained that, how the FUCK does it happen again for 10 fucking years in a row to make it a whole fucking decade since a smart person was allowed to have any of the latest technology implemented in a car they're buying?

Once you've explained that

#HOW THE FUCK DO WE GO FROM 1 DECADE TO MORE THAN 1

#WITH THE GOVERNMENT STILL FUCKING NOT BEING INVOLVED AT ALL

#YOU ABSOLUTE FUCKING RETARD

#I ALREADY KNOW YOUR DUMB ASS IS JUST GOING TO SAY "THERE IS ZERO MARKET FOR INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED PRODUCTS IN THE US AND EVERY COMPANY KNOWS IT IT'S JUST BUSINESS SO THEY SAVE EVERY SINGLE THING A SMART PERSON WOULD BUY FOR EVERY OTHER WESTERN COUNTRY IN THE WORLD INSTEAD"

#But I want to hear you say that fucking RETARDED BULLSHIT 3 FUCKING TIMES without realizing how fucking retarded you sound, so please answer the above 3 questions SEPARATELY. 

#Tell me about how that first year was just business, and that first decade was just business, and then we started setting a record of consecutive decades without a single fucking person at a single fucking company in the fucking world trying to sell a good design in the US but being stopped by the government.

Not really lol
Are you me and I started another account?
My poots took a kick in the dick this morning but they still have 2 weeks to live. I'm oddly calm. I just don't trust this pump. I'm old enough to remember the false 440 pump of 3 days ago.
Yikes down 90% on my spy puts expiring tomorrow fuk it I’ll just let them expire worthless at this point AMD to 120 tho hopefully Cramer doesn’t sabotage it by calling it a memestock again
At worst you lost the premium. Probably the best case, too.
Haha I feel you man 2k shares deep at an average of 6.08. I keep buying, this is what I felt with GME and AMC
Okay bulls got a nice open but now it's just stagnat. It could run abit or tank. Like literally no momentum atm

Alright. I admit it. I regret the position I put on yesterday when they said that taper was imminent. I forgot that the market is stupid and irrational. My bad. Please let the market tank a bit so I can get out of my stupid position please and thanks.

Yea I was waiting for atleast 6.50 to buy more but it may have broken out of that wedge, whatever still have 8c leaps
Fuck you

You can fucking swear on the internet
I’ve been on this sub for something like 3 years. Every put fucks me in the ass, calls only like 40% of the time.
wow. inflation sucks
Got you
good thing ur not an economist
Ticketmaster can suck my dick. Fees and taxes were like 1/2 my ticket cost. 

Anywho has anyone see rolling stones on this tour? Good?
Cramers morning energy is fucking insane, now back to the chart I’m still under the firm belief from yesterday that due to the high PCR of puts to call we continue to rise because there are way to many puts, I’m selling puts as soon we open &amp; looking for short term entries to call. I’m not sure what EOD Friday will bring but this is an obvious tactic to stomp outs puts &amp; I’m gonna cut my losses. If this thing does drop it wont be until EOD Friday at the last minute of expire….no thanks
SPY makes me feel warm inside
Even if they buy puts today?
Those that bought SPY $430 puts expiring early next week (😞), holding through the storm or cutting losses after any sort of dip today?
Don’t do it Josh, it’s hot
Well I mean it's not a bag until you're underwater, right now it's a balloon.
Will this be a mythical 2% SPY day?
Nah.  The more money I make the more I am disgusted by you gross, unwashed poors.

That moment when you realize everyone is beating earnings forecasts because they increased prices to match their own inflation and the products sold likely decreased in quantity because the supply chain bottlenecks are slowing delivery

Source? My understanding is we slowed production down due to pandemic. It takes time to ramp production back up so demand is out pacing supply.
Wasn’t averaged down enough. His basis was .56 cents
It might but that’s one crowded trade rn. Every fund manager I’ve talked to this month is looking at it
Depends if GameStop goes to a million a share or not.

CLNE has had a good couple of weeks. Looking good in the premarket, usually Thursdays are a good day. 

Analysts still have the 1 yr price at $14.88, current price is $9.14. Up 1.2% in the premarket. I wouldn't be surprised if it finishes between $9.50 and $9.60 this week. 

The big jump later in the day yesterday was due to some call options.
For sure, but gotta make sure you look at every third item to make sure there’s no funny business  going on
Ugh it's called a custom bet you dongus!

i say sell off on SPY and QQQ first hour of the market and then resume upward.
It’s going to come out hot.  I think the 9:31 price is the cheapest all day.
!banbet if my AMD and BAC calls print I'm fucking my neighbors wife tonight, if not I guess I'll just fuck my own.
So the market offers us the following options: 
  
Go long completely blind, because nothing about the economy is reflected in the market anymore and pray the market makers don't just take your money. 
  
Go short and play the irrational market vs. personal solvency game of financial chicken.
$SKLZ lets go. Once this company makes money, and they will soon we will see $25+!
Lmao ten scoops
Wait… did this guy just say it’s a 50/50? I typically say that when I have no clue about something…
I'm guessing a spike is possibly, but my gut is saying a 436 close tomorrow. Why? Because I'm usually wrong lol.
A lot of people can live like that. Good jobs are being left by one parent to start a family or realized they don't need 2 incomes. Or boomers retired since they couldn't because of 2008. ( my moms work lost 1/2 their people due to this and she is retiring this year). That gives lower level people the ability to move up and replace their significant others income (many part timers due to children)

The work force contraction isnt just people don't want to work, it's that they don't have to. At my work all the good jobs get filled, all the shit ones keep having openings.  That's because they can go somewhere else make the same money for non-shit work.
Shit had me pissed 😤

Gamma Read for 14 OCT

SPY Γ: +442/+445 for this week OPEX. Not going to force a trade here but will buy any dip in the first hour. Trade expirations 2 weeks out.   
\+443/+450 for 22 OCT OPEX. Same deal. Big money is betting here next week. Ceiling is $450 strike.

AMD looks played put at $111. Option chain centered at $105. Will look for an exit today on NOV 110c

Wow! Amazing!
Bro I don't give a shit about this argument. Call possession of a Tesla "ownership" or don't, it won't magically change the fact that if you buy a Tesla you can't expect to get jack shit of what you paid for, there are no promises, everything about the product and the process of obtaining it was designed to be untrustworthy as fuck just so that you "can't complain" when you get fucked and the company can expect if you were dumb enough to buy the product in the first place you'll be dumb enough to just buy another one when the one you got fucks you, and if you find out about a car that is worth what you pay for, you will find out it's not available in America, every fucking time, just like lots of other types of product that have gotten technologically powerful. I'm fucking sick of my fellow countrymen for allowing the government to stop me from having anything worth a shit.

You’re 🌈 but you might not be wrong
Goddamn. Enjoy your ban, you certainly earned it.

Call them and tell them to make it a cash account and day trade to your heart's content. Or just open another account with another broker.

Lmao, I'd suggest reading some more about the market before you read here.

After you buy or sell something, it takes T+2 business days to settle (so if I bought or sold on Monday, the transaction would settle on Wednesday, assuming no holidays). If you're on margin you don't see this, but you do with cash accounts. Regardless of account types, you'll need your trade to settle before the end of the last full business day in 2021 to ensure you don't get hit with wash sale tax issues. I'd sell before Christmas to take advantage of the Santa rally if I were you.
Socks and sandals?
It just kept going up and I couldn’t stop lol
The massive bubble is due to computers trading faster than people selling.  I’ve watched for far to long a computer can buy 1 share at a time rapidly driving the price higher as people HODL.  We marched higher not on real money but on manipulation.  How fast do we decline if this ever stops or were the algos designed to always keep the bubble going?
Had to say goodbye to a 15 y/o lab on Monday and a 13 y/o husky six months ago. Absolute dick punches.

I think you’re confusing title of personal property (vehicle ownership) with copyright ownership (software/code).

When you buy a Tesla, you own the vehicle. Whatever weird shit you’re spouting doesn’t change that lol just go buy one if you want one 😂

Only thing that would happen if you modified the code is you would lose your warranty, they can’t repossess it hahaha
We should take $25 today
Don’t worry, there’s plenty to go around for everyone.

It’s time for the SOFI pump. Let’s do this retards. 🌝 time 📈📈
Selling calls at open, buying puts when the pump stops maybe around 441-442. Should be around 10:30
It's in a place right now where it could easily drop back to the 47 range where a lot of volume is. Stays above 68 then I'm in.

Highly recommended but unfortunately 2 week quarantine is unavoidable until further notice. Pre Covid you could walk right in and get a 90 day tourist visa as long as you had a exit ticket in hand. $40 Visa run to Japan…ahhh glory days. 

CPNG’s biggest threat is the Chaebols (interesting wiki read if that’s your thing). They’re omnipresent here and really hold Korean society back imo. If CPNG can dominate Korea and use that free cashflow as a springboard to expand into SEA, they could see decades of aggressive growth. If you order something before midnight it’s delivered before noon 🤯, unrivaled service. I think Seoul is on the cusp of exploding and being on par with any western global city, but I am biased.

A man stands alone in a lightly wooded forest.

He pulls out of his pocket a device, lovingly crafted in wood.  It is an L.L. Bean Triple Premium Wilderness Outfitters bear call.  It replicates the springtime sounds of a lady bear in heat.

He puts the business end to his lips, a modern-day Roland, and winds the call.  The rutting, hideous grunting noise shatters the serenity.  Again and again he blows it.

And no bears come.

"Why even bother having a bear; or being a bear; in this day and age," the man wonders.  He puts the bear call back into his pocket.  He walks into town for coffee.
Today is CLOV day ?

Wow that's great, I really want to visit. And thank you for the glowing review of Coupang. I did as much research on it as I could, and it feels like a well oiled machine. Also way less shady/scummy business practices compared to Amazon. Korea looks to be about 1/6th the size of the states, yet CPNG is 1/30 of Amazon (I understand they don't offer anything like AWS, but that is only 12% of Amazon revenue).

Because you might not know that rear defrosters can help? It's pretty clear that you haven't owned a car without a rear wiper before and I was trying to let you know they're not lost causes. You don't need something to be as efficient as a wiper to have the functionality you're saying is exclusive to a wiper.

Just trying to be helpful, but clearly you're just angry.
Supply chain broken.
To be clear, I think pumping a stock +50% in one day is a great thing. I also support massive collusion on this sub because fuck em, however, I find it slightly greedy for people to express disappoint at a 10% pump, for I would rather +10% everyday than +50% every 5 days. Finally, the user simulator bot ransom noting together random phrases I've posted throughout is not the quality of digital replication I seek.

Market has officially “digested” this narrative to get cheaper shares over the last month. MM’s want their money now that they are well positioned again.

Stock go up!

Bulls always win 🥰
Did anyone let the bears know they are fucked?
If you understand that it's less efficient then why the fuck are you wasting my time telling me about it?
That usually means puts are the play. I’m bullish long term tho

Lol Jesus dude, learn to fucking read before you explode please. Where did I ever say that it was more efficient?

Yes.

Hang onto that BABA, could take a couple years but i believe it will see new ATH ($320+). I’m diamond handing that shit. Chinese stocks are obscenely volatile. I don’t even look at my portfolio on red days any more. I’m not selling before LTCG so why let it ruin your mood?

We all like 10 Baggerz but they don't come around every day, only like twice a week. If you start with $100 it only takes four 10 Baggerz to get to a Million, but then you still have to pay taxes, so maybe for something safe to double up and be left with a million. 

If you want a slower safer investment plan, take 10% of your portfolio and sell at a 5% gain. If you are a poor (like me) and can only do 3 daytrades a week you can do this 156 times a year for returns of 78% (non-compounded simple math which probably means it's closer to 120% if I was smart enough to do the compounding still)

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735) no more words needed
Wow I’m feeling inflated
Bears, every single person in any position of authority in this country has a shit ton of money in equities. Did you really think they would let it keep dropping? 

This isn't that hard.
So nothing much. Way to hold the line gents!!
Yes, I'm looking for a car I can actually use for transportation not just to show off to idiots who find owning a car impressive on days with nice weather

Imagine paying FIFTY FUCKING THOUSAND DOLLARS for a car and then being like "hold up I gotta be careful where I park, this car can't park anywhere I'd have to back out of because then if the weather changes I won't be able to see"
What is the best metric to use when deciding if a growth company is under valued or not? EPS, EBITDA etc or what?
So I'm listening to a local radio station that does financial news and local politics and some guy is really mad about people in city Hall having toasters in their office.  Supposedly when he goes to city hall to get service the workers all spend their first hour of the day making and eating buttered toast and won't help until 9:30am.  Dude has called in an complained about the toast eaters 2 times normally and once when the mayor was on.  🤷🏿‍♂️

I really want the financial news more but I'm pretty curious about the volume of toasters at city hall.
Lol I want to believe this rally will hold.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
thinking of buying CUBE (CubeSmart) stock.
Thoughts?
Didn’t it happen Monday where Spy rallied like 4 points to 440 range and the tanked mid day to 432?  Was that Monday? I can’t remember anything anymore.
You already paid for it, no refunds
No rear wiper is a deal breaker?
And this, my bois, is why you get expirations like a few months out. 

November-December SPY calls were ridiculously cheap yesterday lmao.
Yes look up how to trade with rsi on YouTube, Idk why that isn’t mentioned here enough trading without TA is literally straight gambling
Bank CEO’s cumming so hard right now.
Well darn, I guess I shoulda bought more calls yesterday. Oh well at least I have a few and a green market just feels better. 
Are we thinking a slight dump in the first 10 min &amp; then back up or just all up?
It's not the tiger king, we need something better more rednecks to unite this country
Buy SOXL or EWT
Dump calls at open, buy puts, sell puts later today, buy calls again.
Fam... stop holding bags. They’re fucking empty.
DRAM prices are going to drop even further from here as supply chain fattens up.

Only hope is that CPU output increases and the demand continues. Otherwise....not looking that great

Palantir to 25$ 🚀
I would sell half at open and ride the rest. Maybe sell a few periodically if you’re happy. Set a price you want to sell at and stick to it though. Make the trade and move on to the next play regardless of if you sell early or not
Stop loss in a good profit and walk away a winner if it hits.
God damnit I NEED $450 Friday close
Hey guys I’m back I got pdt but I’m still going to test my luck and hold options over night :)

I've been waiting so many years for a new car worth buying and I thought the Hyundai Ioniq 5 was gonna be it but apparently it's missing rear wipers. What the fuck. I give up, at this point I don't think there's ever going to be anything new enough to use an electric drivetrain without being completely fucked up and unusable in some retarded way

Sooo all my SPY call holders. Hold and sell later in the day or get rid of them at open? Rocking 10/18 $437 25 contracts.
Considering TSMC, I'm thinking it's pumping tech season, but then again everyone here is ultra bullish and if there's one rule it's always inverse wsb so what to do?
Imagine not buying spy calls yesterday. LFG
You’ll chase for sure
I WAS STRESSING THIS WEEK 😭😭😭 my calls will finally pay off 😂😂  I just was tired of seeing red.
MU starting to look cheap.
SPY still in 430s, PLTR still about 24. Inflation is perpetually transitory. Welcome back.
It’s like when you edge for a week before meeting someone in an Airbnb in Vancouver to blast all over their face
Isn't the market finally going up because the fed finally unveiled their tapering timeline yesterday? The market hates uncertainty.

Was in a similar boat. Holding what I was through last earnings bit me in the ass. They’re projecting revenue estimates to remain the same (not great, not bad) for the next two quarters. Just gonna play the earning run ups.
Tried squeezing lemon for my PLTR calls... Didnt work. What do?
Gotta be DFV.

You're laughing now but I have something short to squeeze every night before I head to bed. Hasn't failed me yet
Back in the TSLA days I saw a 2 million gain off of like $20k in calls.
Im thinking that gettin fucked in a normal way is boring me, I wanna get QUANTUM FUCKED, calls on $IONQ 🤤
Stocks are going up because bonds and the dollar are pulling back.  Bonds and the dollar are at their uptrend support lines, and stocks are now at a resistance level.  That means the conditions are right for things to reverse again.  Don't chase.

Why is spy up bigly
WHY IS IT STILL GOING UP WHAT THE FUCK
Up almost 1% on SPY in premarket. Bears r FUK
Should I not sell covered calls past earnings if there's a chance the stock will tank (like, if I need to quickly bail)? I got fucked last time, and I'm too dumb to know how to prevent this shit

I'm a bull but these random rips are so stupid. I want SPY at 200 MA so I can buy the real dip.
It could've been a blog post too what's your point?
You had a good dream last night body.
Yes child...this is the way

I have $110-$114 spreads on TSM. Trying to decide if I close the whole spread or buy the 114's back and let the 110's run.

Yep. He's probably meaning jobless claims
Indeed, I would have done things differently in hindsight. Like selling GOEV when it ran up north of $20 after merger. Sigh.

Good morning retards. Are we making money today?
It’s very bad to ruminate, it doesn’t actually fix anything. I don’t mean work him to death, I mean give him a way to fall into work instead of into the mind hole of his family dying where he is powerless to do anything to help. When people lose support structure like family, they are at their most vulnerable, so giving him some way to feel like he is fully a part of something could help him. Even if it’s just something to do so that he’s not raking himself over the coals about things which he isn’t responsible for and can do nothing about. Obviously spending time with them while they are alive is important, but as they die, he’s going to need some way to avoid the overwhelming feelings that come with death.  Having a place to channel his mental energy could very well be what he needs. Some people will need less hours, Some people will need more. Everyone grieves in their own way.
There’s so many problems here I don’t know where to start. Yea sure, places like Kansas suck but have you even been to say Colorado or Arizona? Hell, have you been to central Texas? There’s plenty of natural beauty besides beaches.

Thoughts on BABA?
SPY is another classic WSB pump and dump. You've never used their products. You don't know anyone who does. Do not fall for this.
I'd like to see your calculations for that figure. They're already trading at 40x their own estimates of 2022 revenue (that's revenue, not earnings). There are tons of new players coming into the market, including the credit card companies. 

Also, who does Affirm have for customers in January? I mean, if everyone maxes out their Affirm credit on Amazon, who can Affirm loan to?
i mean it wouldn't necessarily be stupid but there are probably plays that are equally as boring and as beneficial if not more
Bro, at least on the north east the water sucks. Lake effect snow is not the vibe

The plains, mountains, forests are all pretty beautiful, say nothing of like the grand canyon and yosemite and the like. I drove from Pittsburgh to Texas and back a couple times last year and the eastern southern states all had a ton of charm and life.
Why didn’t I buy calls yesterday? I should have bought some before close at last. Feel like something possessed me and I turned into a gay bear yesterday

Same got out of sdc and clov last month. So many opportunities in the market, sometimes just have to admit we make bad choice and get out
So not a pump… legit value. Rip my puts.
It will be soon if you don’t dump that shit and actually get into something good. Now if you bought it round 4- low 5, then you straight
So why did you delete the post Mister
i'm not buying or selling anything for the rest of the week just holding

then next week i'll buy even more AAPL, ARKK, and SPY
Yeah she likes to run with us high riding cowboys
I truly believe $CLOV will open above $7 and close below $10
You’ll get it back, when do they expire?
Or just buy google stock and sell covered puts and make free money
He's gonna need the money and distraction.
Ain’t no way you can lose in the market. Now if you playing with shit stocks then that’s your fault. Most tickers that are popular will get your money back easy with a long haul wait

Having been born on the Mediterranean I can't imagine living more than a hour from it. There must even be people who have never seen the sea / ocean. Unfathomable...

Seriously if you SDC fuckers actually have good DD, I’ll stop being so anti SDC. But I lost over 2k in that shit hole and my eyes finally open to know that’s a classic P&amp;D that ended when it hit $7

If your feeling helpless cause every trade you make loses just remember you are not weak but strong.  You are like the death star with power to instantly destroy any stock by simply buying calls
Found a Slack trading group offering a free trial this week on Twitter and the guy running it went balls deep on AMD, SQ, and QQQ puts and shorts yesterday.

Broken dreams...
You WILL watch Squid Games

You WILL buy Korean Amazon ($CPNG)

You WILL be happy
MSFT is done with the dip.
Who knows but this gap up in SPY doesn't bode well. Usually a small bump then massive green candle is what you want, not this huge gap and then fade into the close. This just screws both put and call buyers the same. If SPY holds above 442, then 450 is back in play by EOM.
Yup, looks like we’re setting up for a face ripper out there.
Customers should have cars in their garages in the next 2-3 weeks.

Short it if you want, but I'd wait a month or 2 to get maximum results.

I got some pretty **garbage** news yesterday. one of the guys who works under me informed me that his maternal grandmother is "circling the drain". This is on top of the fact that his mom's cancer has progressed to the doctor saying that "treatments won't do anything other than end her life faster". I told him that whenever he needs, he can go be with them, but like..**.damn bro** *I don't know how to help you :(*

No they won't, you sold them.  and 70% profit is excellent.

i once visited a friend in long beach california and we went to a party and apparently people there listen exclusively to sublime it was so lame
Why I sold my AFRM stock:

1. I made a crap ton on the way up.
2. All the good news is priced-in (and then some).
3. I expect a large capital raise at these levels (something like 20 million new shares).
4. The other Target BNPL partner has just an $850m market cap (compared to AFRM near $40b), and is ripe for a buyout by one of the big banks/cc companies that feels they need to get into this space. 

Do your own DD on the other Target partner. I can't name them on WSB b/c of market cap, but their name rhymes with Fezzle.

RIOT is primed for a rally.  Digital currency are up 70% to 100% last 3 months and keep going.  However RIOT the miner that doubled total number of it's coins holding in same time period . In addition the value went up. So, it actually quadrupled it coin value.  However the stock dropped from $77 to $26. This stock should be at $150 or more now and not $26. Shorts can hold it down for a while before explodes higher. Watch RIOT for a big rally ...

AFRM has gotten way ahead of itself. They've been a partner with Target for years, yet everyone thought it was breaking news last week. Target has two partners doing BNPL, the other is a Minneapolis-based company (like Target) and trades OTC. Their market cap is about 50x smaller than AFRM. 

I am way long the stock I cannot name here (because of their $850m market cap).

I gotta say, holding BABA puts and SPY calls over the course of time seems to always be the play. If spy goes red, buy calls. If baba goes green, wait a day and buy puts
IRNT calls. Held overnight accidentally.

Craziest feeling I have had so far is putting $900 into some AMC calls when they had their run and watching it go up thousands of dollars in minutes. Watched it hit 14k at one point. But I didn't want to "paper hand" it. So I ended up selling for like 9k, but my first 10 bagger was AMC. What was your guys first 10 bagger?

We may because of capital flight from oil companies and intentional scarcity. It’s happening with big oil and coal in the US right now. They are not investing in exploration and pumping their prices by returning capital to investors instead. This is natural for the late stage if this energy type.

I had to hedge against the risk of actually making any money.
What people don’t realize is that high oil prices will just drive clean energy initiatives further for products that can be operated without oil. Capitalism dictates that the material that’s cheaper to operate gets used. If electric vehicles are cheaper to build and maintain then combustion engines inevitably get left behind. EV parts get cheaper due to more supply. Look at coal.

And yes, I know a ton of manufacturing and engineering requires oils and petroleum products so it’s not going away entirely.
Puts at open on SPY?

Got it, buying calls.

Got it, buying a strangle.

Got it, selling a condor.

Id be cautious, SOFI pump not following the normal pump pattern. Unless I missed it that is. 

Normally the pump starts with 3-4 yolo posts suddenly appearing on the top page and a random 1-2 DD appearing and receiving and odd amount of awards. When you see that stuff appear out of the blue, you know the ticker is in for a 3 day day pump and dump cycle

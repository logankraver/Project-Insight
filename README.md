# Project-Insight
Project Insight is a personal project, where I attempted to scrape all comments from the daily r/Wallstreetbets discussion posts in order to determine mentions of stock tickers.

The Webscraping file is the library that contains all the functions that the other scripts files utilize in order to perform the specific scraping techniques. The code utilizes the PRAW and selenium python libraries along with the pushshift api to perform different techniques to find and scrape comments from individual posts.
